# AdventOfCode2018

This repository was created to store and show my take on the challenges of this year's edition of Advent of code created by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/). 
The official site of the competition is [this](https://adventofcode.com/about) and for the [questions](https://adventofcode.com/2018).


Every solution will be pushed on the repository on the day of the challenge or the following days, depending on my disponibility.

The main structure for each day is the following:
1. each day it is created a new folder
2. almost each part of the day(there are two) will be put in its own separate folder
3. in each subfolder there will be two files:
  * the c++ file named conventionally main.cpp
  * the input file named data.in
